0,1,1,Pilot,John,Harry! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.
1,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"What, John? What’s going on?"
2,1,1,Pilot,John,"I got a surprise for you, Harry."
3,1,1,Pilot,Harry,It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
4,1,1,Pilot,John,"Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up."
5,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
6,1,1,Pilot,John,"We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Harry."
7,1,1,Pilot,John,"What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Harry? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage."
8,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Yeah, John... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?"
9,1,1,Pilot,John,"Harry. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Harry. I had to create a bomb."
10,1,1,Pilot,Harry,What?! A bomb?!
11,1,1,Pilot,John,"We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Harry. Create a whole fresh start."
12,1,1,Pilot,Harry,T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
13,1,1,Pilot,John,"Come on, Harry. Just take it easy, Harry. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica."
14,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Jessica? From my math class?
15,1,1,Pilot,John,"When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam."
16,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Ohh...
17,1,1,Pilot,John,And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
18,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Whhhh-wha?
19,1,1,Pilot,John,"And so that's the surprise, Harry."
20,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!"
21,1,1,Pilot,John,"I-I get what you're trying to say, Harry. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Harry."
22,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"What are you talking about, John?"
23,1,1,Pilot,John,"You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Harry."
24,1,1,Pilot,Harry,I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—
25,1,1,Pilot,John,"You know what, Harry? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways."
27,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"That's it... that's it, John. I'm taking the wheel."
28,1,1,Pilot,John,"Get off of me, Harry!"
29,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!"
30,1,1,Pilot,John,"Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Harry."
31,1,1,Pilot,John,Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
32,1,1,Pilot,John,"We'll park it right here, Harry. Right here on the side of the ree... road here."
33,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, thank god."
34,1,1,Pilot,John,"You know what? That was all a test, Harry. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive."
35,1,1,Pilot,Harry,It was?
36,1,1,Pilot,John,"Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—"
38,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Um...
39,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
40,1,1,Pilot,Summer,"Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke."
41,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Harry, are you getting sick?  I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it."
42,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something."
43,1,1,Pilot,Summer,Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa John.
44,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,What?
45,1,1,Pilot,Beth,Dad?
46,1,1,Pilot,John,"What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"
47,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,Damn it!
48,1,1,Pilot,Beth,Jerry!
49,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,Beth!
50,1,1,Pilot,Summer,"Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die."
51,1,1,Pilot,John,"Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later."
52,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay, with all due respect, John— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?"
53,1,1,Pilot,John,"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
54,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Oh, dad…"
55,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,What? For real?
56,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows!"
57,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math? And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two."
59,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Jessica.
60,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Five plus five.
62,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Jessica.
63,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Okay, good. It's time for the quiz."
65,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room.  There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3"
66,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Hi, Harry."
67,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Whoa! Hi, Jessica."
68,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,Can I show these to you?
69,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!
70,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,You know what I named these? My little Morties.
71,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird."
72,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,Do you know what I want you to do with them?
73,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Rename them?
74,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers."
75,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot."
76,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Mm. Oh, Harry. What are you doing to me?"
77,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Uh, I-I'm just doing my best."
78,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Harry! What are you doing to me?!
79,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Ah, Jessica."
80,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Harry!
81,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Jessica.
82,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad."
83,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Je-Jessica. Jessica.
84,1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Not my fault this is happening.
86,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Uh, morning, Frank."
88,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
90,1,1,Pilot,John,"There you are, Harry. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
91,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, geez, John. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?"
92,1,1,Pilot,John,"It's pretty obvious, Harry. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Harry. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Harry."
93,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"I don't know, John. I can't leave school again."
94,1,1,Pilot,John,"Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Harry? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!"
95,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?"
96,1,1,Pilot,John,"I'll do it later, Harry. He'll be fine. Let's go."
98,1,1,Pilot,Summer,"Hi, Frank."
99,1,1,Pilot,Summer,AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
100,1,1,Pilot,Beth,Scalpel.
102,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Knock, knock."
103,1,1,Pilot,Beth,Jerry?
104,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"""
107,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason."
108,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia."
111,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
112,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, yeah, on horses."
113,1,1,Pilot,Beth,Excuse me?
114,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way."
115,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home."
117,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!"
118,1,1,Pilot,John,"There she is. All right. Come on, Harry. Let's go."
119,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, geez, okay."
120,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, man, John. What is this place?"
121,1,1,Pilot,John,"It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Harry, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Harry."
122,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, man, John. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
123,1,1,Pilot,John,"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Harry. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Harry, we're gonna be—"
124,1,1,Pilot,John,"HOLY CRAP, Harry RUN!!!"
125,1,1,Pilot,John,"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Harry! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Harry!"
126,1,1,Pilot,John,"Oh, Harry, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Harry. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Harry. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
127,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"All right, John, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?"
128,1,1,Pilot,John,"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing."
129,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Yeah, John, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave."
130,1,1,Pilot,John,"Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Harry, you see this?"
131,1,1,Pilot,John,"You see what we just stumbled upon, Harry? Any idea what that is down there?"
132,1,1,Pilot,Harry,The mega trees?
133,1,1,Pilot,John,"That's right, Harry the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Harry. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school."
134,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?"
135,1,1,Pilot,John,"You ask a lot of questions, Harry. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure."
136,1,1,Pilot,John,"Just take these shoes, Harry. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Harry up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
137,1,1,Pilot,Harry,AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
138,1,1,Pilot,John,"You have to turn them on, Harry! The shoes have to be turned on!"
139,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?"
140,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son."
142,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"It's fine, Davin."
144,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
145,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Harry was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see John having is that, for the first time in his life, Harry has a friend."
146,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, maybe you're right."
147,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?"
148,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Ahem, Horse heart surgeon."
149,1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Harry's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"
150,1,1,Pilot,John,"Harry, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Harry, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
151,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"I'm in a lot of pain, John!"
152,1,1,Pilot,John,"Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Harry?"
153,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Are you kidding me?! That's it, John! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something."
154,1,1,Pilot,John,"Okay, hold on just a second, Harry."
155,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
156,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, John. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you."
157,1,1,Pilot,John,"Don't worry about it, Harry. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?"
158,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Sure thing, John."
159,1,1,Pilot,John,"Not that you asked, Harry, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Harry."
160,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Wow, that's pretty crazy, John."
161,1,1,Pilot,John,"There's just one problem, Harry one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Harry, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Harry.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Harry, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Harry. It's got no charge left."
162,1,1,Pilot,Harry,What?!
163,1,1,Pilot,John,"It's as good as garbage, Harry. It's not gonna work anymore, Harry."
164,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, geez, John, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?"
165,1,1,Pilot,John,"There's ways to get back home, Harry. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid."
166,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Uh-oh.
167,1,1,Pilot,John,"When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Harry."
168,1,1,Pilot,Harry,In my butt?
169,1,1,Pilot,John,"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
170,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, geez, John. I really don't want to have to do that."
171,1,1,Pilot,John,"Well, somebody's got to do it, Harry. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Harry"
172,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Uuuh.
173,1,1,Pilot,John,"And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Harry. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Harry. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt."
174,1,1,Pilot,Harry,In my butt?
175,1,1,Pilot,John,"Come on, Harry. Please, Harry. You have to do it, Harry."
176,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, man."
177,1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"The fact is, your son, Harry, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
178,1,1,Pilot,Beth,What? Why didn't you notify us?
179,1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Harry's grandfather?
180,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?"
181,1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Harry's grandpa that's taking him out of school."
182,1,1,Pilot,Beth,Summer?
183,1,1,Pilot,Summer,What kind of God lets this happen?
184,1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death.  And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them.
185,1,1,Pilot,Announcer,The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
188,1,1,Pilot,Announcer,The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
189,1,1,Pilot,John,"I don't like it here, Harry. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?"
190,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Yeah, John. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt."
191,1,1,Pilot,John,"That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Harry. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-"
194,1,1,Pilot,John,Why does he have to go over there?
196,1,1,Pilot,John,What new-  what new machine?
198,1,1,Pilot,John,"Run, Harry! Run!"
199,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Aaaaaah!
201,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Ohhhhh!
202,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Ohhhhhh!
203,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Aaaaah!
204,1,1,Pilot,John,Don't think about it!
205,1,1,Pilot,John,"Ooh! Oh, nice, Harry! The student becomes the teacher."
206,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Whoooooo!
208,1,1,Pilot,John,"I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Harry. Cover me."
209,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody."
210,1,1,Pilot,John,"They're just robots, Harry! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!"
213,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"They're not robots, John!"
214,1,1,Pilot,John,"It's a figure of speech, Harry. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Harry. You have no idea what prison is like here!"
215,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Holy crap! This is insane!
216,1,1,Pilot,John,"Come on, Harry! We got to get the hell out of here!"
217,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
218,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding."
219,1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"You're Harry, right?"
220,1,1,Pilot,Harry,Yeah.
221,1,1,Pilot,John,"You can get his number later. Come on, Harry. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass."
222,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche."
223,1,1,Pilot,Beth,What?
224,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"I'm an angry father, not an improviser."
225,1,1,Pilot,John,"Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Harry! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?"
226,1,1,Pilot,John,You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
227,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,You're beyond our reasoning!
228,1,1,Pilot,John,Takes one to know one.
229,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's."
230,1,1,Pilot,John,What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
231,1,1,Pilot,Beth,We're moving you to a nursing home.
232,1,1,Pilot,John,"A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun."
233,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas."
234,1,1,Pilot,Beth,What does that mean?
235,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,It's personal.
236,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Dad, mom, come on. John just needed my help is all."
237,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Harry, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
238,1,1,Pilot,John,What are you trying to say about Harry? That he's stupid or something?
239,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Harry is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
240,1,1,Pilot,John,I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
241,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?"
242,1,1,Pilot,Harry,I do?
243,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Harry, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard."
244,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
245,1,1,Pilot,John,"Harry, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
246,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Oh, come on, John. You know I can't."
247,1,1,Pilot,John,"The square root of Pi, Harry. Go!"
248,1,1,Pilot,Harry,1.77245385... Whoa!
249,1,1,Pilot,Beth,What the hell?
250,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,Holy crap. He's right.
251,1,1,Pilot,John,"Harry, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
252,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I'm so smart!"
253,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,But—
254,1,1,Pilot,John,I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Harry's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
255,1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop."
256,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
257,1,1,Pilot,John,"Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication."
258,1,1,Pilot,Summer,Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!
259,1,1,Pilot,John,No idea what you're talking about.
260,1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay. Well, uh, Harry, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you."
261,1,1,Pilot,Beth,You know what? Okay.
262,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Holy cow, John. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
263,1,1,Pilot,John,"Full disclosure, Harry it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
264,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Aw, man."
265,1,1,Pilot,John,"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Harry."
267,1,1,Pilot,Harry,"Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh."
268,1,1,Pilot,John,"I'm sorry, Harry. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Harry and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Harry, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Harry but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Harry, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Harry. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Harry. Just you and me, Harry. The outside world is our enemy, Harry. We're the only friends we've got, Harry. It's just John and Harry. John and Harry and their adventures, Harry. John and Harry forever and forever. Harry's things. Me and John and Harry running around, and John and Harry time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. John and Harry forever 100 times. Over and over, JohnandHarryadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, JohnandHarry.com."
270,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?
271,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Outside?
272,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Are you kidding me?! Come on!
273,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Oh, my God."
274,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,What's wrong?
275,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Your idiot dog!
276,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy."
277,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Don't praise him now, Harry! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!"
278,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Harry, come on. I need your help tonight."
279,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Hey, wait, hold on a second, John. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"
280,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Harry."
281,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Listen, John, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Harry's grounded!"
282,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Ha-ha!
283,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Aw, man!"
284,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
285,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"All right, Ruffles What's his name?"
286,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Snuffles.
287,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Snuffles, shake."
288,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Roll over.
289,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Go to the bathroom.
290,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Holy crap!
291,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,No way.
292,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Harry."
293,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"That was fantastic, John!"
294,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Yeah, Harry, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one."
295,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,W-w-w-what is it?
296,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"It's a device, Harry, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Harry. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about."
297,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"You talking about ""Inception""?"
298,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"That's right, Harry. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense."
299,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"""Inception"" made sense."
300,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"You don't have to try to impress me, Harry. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Harry. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Harry, all the time."
301,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Geez, John, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?"
302,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Are you listening to me, Harry? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it."
303,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me."
304,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You don't know me!
305,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice."
307,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You don't know me!
309,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Uh-oh! Spoilers!
310,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,I'm a full season behind.
311,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Wow, John, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird."
312,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Harry."
313,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,Wheat thins. Wheat thins.
314,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,I'll take two.
315,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,"Oh, I think you've had enough, sir."
317,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"All right, Harry, time to make our move."
318,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,Make it bounce.
319,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,"No, you didn't."
320,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, jiggle it now."
321,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You better stop with that.
322,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Harry Smith gets better grades in math!
323,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"
324,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
325,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Take cover, Harry!"
326,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
327,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Ooohhh!
328,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Harry but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Harry."
329,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
330,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Harry. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!"
331,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Now bring me my slippers.
332,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Now, be my footstool, Snuffles."
333,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
335,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?"
336,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!
337,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome."
338,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!
339,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna""."
340,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Ooooyayawawa!
341,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"He's saying ""I love Obama"".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now."
342,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
343,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Hmm?
344,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!"
346,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
347,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
349,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Oh, no, Harry. His subconscious is panicking."
352,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
353,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
354,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
355,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Relax, Harry. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!"
356,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,"Hey, you don't know me!"
357,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, no, John, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!"
358,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Pretty concise, Harry. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Harry! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Harry. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!"
359,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You don't know m-
360,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"All right, let's go."
361,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, man, John, this is pretty weird."
362,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Don't judge, Harry."
363,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up."
364,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Whoa, whoa, Harry, the tJohn to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch."
366,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Ooh, oh! Oh, man."
368,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"I'm sorry. No, no."
370,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"No, thanks!"
372,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"No, I'm okay."
373,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Whoa!
375,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?"
376,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
377,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Harry? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here."
378,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"It's Summer! Aw, geez."
380,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich."
384,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Time to go another dream deep, Harry!"
385,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
387,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Geez, I don't know, Harry. Wha-what do you want from me?"
388,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!"
389,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Oh, here we go!"
390,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
391,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
392,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
393,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?"
394,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Snuffles fix. Make better.
395,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!
396,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
397,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over."
398,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away."
399,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Why not?
400,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,I don't know. It's Indian giving.
402,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
404,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Harry!"
405,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!"
407,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,The little girl!
408,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Huh?
410,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Harry."
411,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, geez, John. W-w-whoa, this isn't good."
412,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!"
413,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Ohhhh!
414,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Holy crap, Harry. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!"
415,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?"
417,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Do not call me that!
418,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"""Snuffles"" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white."
419,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me."
420,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Scaring you?
421,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
422,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?"
423,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Uhhh ...
424,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?"
425,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?"
428,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
429,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,You will walk when it is time to walk.
430,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
431,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?"
432,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Oh, yeah."
433,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Buckle up, bitch!"
434,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,Ooooooaaahhh!
435,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!"
436,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
437,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Hold on, Harry. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding."
438,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,But that's the opposite of what-
439,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
440,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, John. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, John."
441,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
442,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, John, that was some good thinking."
443,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Thanks, Harry. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
444,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,You can run But you can't hide!
445,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Oh, this is perfect, Harry. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move."
446,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding."
447,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Dad, he wants to be called snowball."
448,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous."
449,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery."
450,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?
452,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,I don't want to talk about it!
456,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa."
458,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Harry, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
459,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
460,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, boy, John. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry."
461,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!"
463,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, uh, um ... ""Bitch."""
465,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?"
467,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is."
468,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool."
469,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say."
470,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg."
471,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip."
472,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, hey, it's you guys!"
474,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
475,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with."
477,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,I always hated that song!
478,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"These halves don't belong together, bitch!"
479,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,Sex is sacred!
480,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"This is because you don't give Harry Smith good grades, bitch!"
481,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Harry an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought."
482,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,What the hell?
483,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Harry?"
484,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Oh, man, what's going on?"
485,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Harry."
486,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
487,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,This is why I choose to get C's.
488,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer."
489,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,- Dad! - John!
490,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
491,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it."
492,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?"
493,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them."
494,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Bad person. Bad.
495,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Ooh, great plan, Jerry."
496,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Harry. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side."
497,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Th-thanks, snuffles."
498,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Begin phase two.
502,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Mmm. Thank you, Fido. John! I thought you were dead!"
503,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Harry. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon."
504,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,What?
505,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"It's a dream, Harry. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream."
506,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,But I-it's been like a whole year!
507,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Harry, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
508,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants."
509,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Harry. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Harry, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."
510,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Aw, man, geez! Seriously?"
511,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Harry. Here, here take these, Harry. Take these."
512,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?"
513,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
514,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,What?!
515,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"It's necessary for the plan, Harry. Don't even trip, dawg."
517,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Anything. Anything for my precious Harry.
519,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness."
521,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,We are not them! We are not them.
522,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory."
523,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"I'm gonna miss you, snowball."
524,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"You can call me snuffles, Harry, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much."
525,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Beth,Jerry?
526,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller."
527,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Beth,"Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it."
528,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, John."
529,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"I think it will be great, Harry. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Harry, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven."
530,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Harry,"You know, that's a real comforting idea, John."
531,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"What do you know, Harry? What do you know?"
533,1,2,Lawnmower Dog,John,"Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch."
534,1,6,John Potion 9,Principal Vagina,"Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover."
536,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh."
537,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,What's up Harry?
538,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,Ugghh
539,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,What are you doing?
540,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,Ummm
541,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"Wait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?"
542,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Well, I mean, I was thinking about it."
543,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!"
544,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,"Gee, thanks, Brad."
545,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager."
546,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Harry. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape."
547,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!"
548,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
549,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me."
550,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"I beg your pardon, John, INAPPROPRIATE."
551,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Harry, his marriage is hanging from a thread."
552,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"My marriage is fine, thank you."
553,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed."
554,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Come on, John, don't talk about my parents like that."
555,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Listen, Harry, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Harry, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Harry. Rise above. Focus on science."
556,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance."
557,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom."
558,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Harry, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Harry. It's gonna be great."
559,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Hey, listen, John. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?"
560,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Harry, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver."
561,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO John! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, John.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, John? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?"
562,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"You're growing up fast, Harry. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Harry, you know what a vole is?"
563,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Harry. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Harry, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA."
564,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Oh well, okay..."
565,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"A hair, Harry, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones."
566,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,Oww!
567,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Alright, Harry, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Harry?"
568,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa John!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?"
569,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Harry, it's full proof."
570,1,6,John Potion 9,John,"Ugh, unless she has the flu."
571,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"Beth, do you still love me?"
572,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,Want kinda question is that?
573,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"The ""yes"" or ""no"" kind."
574,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?"
575,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,Yess.
576,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,Are you gonna build them?
577,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,Noo.
578,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,"Then what good was the ""yes""?"
579,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,"Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?"
580,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,"Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?"
581,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,Sort of.
582,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital."
583,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,This late?
584,1,6,John Potion 9,Beth,"The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone."
586,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!"
587,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,"Omigod, Harry. You look REALLY nice tonight."
588,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"WOW, thanks!"
589,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,"I love you, Harry. I love you so much it burns!"
590,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!"
591,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?"
592,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,"LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK!  I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE!"
593,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"Aw man, Harry, ugh, I'm really sorry."
594,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Oh, well, no problem Brad."
595,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special."
596,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Whoa, take it easy!"
597,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!
598,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!
599,1,6,John Potion 9,Principal Vagina,That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
600,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,"Oh, Principal Vagina."
601,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,"Never leave me, Harry, NEVER."
602,1,6,John Potion 9,Harry,"Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?"
603,1,6,John Potion 9,Jessica,Who cares? Just hold me.
604,1,6,John Potion 9,Brad,LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU Harry!
605,1,6,John Potion 9,Jerry,She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.
606,1,6,John Potion 9,Summer,"Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting."
607,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Hurry up Harry, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom."
608,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!"
609,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?"
610,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
611,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa John might make me his new sidekick?"
612,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,What? What kind of monster are you?
613,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,A competent one.
614,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
615,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize."
616,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
617,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Harry. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards."
618,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Wait a minute, what?"
619,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,And away we go!
620,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?"
621,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Shhh, Harry!"
622,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed."
623,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety."
624,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Hi, dad."
625,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Summer, Harry, are you okay?"
626,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,W-We just missed you a lot.
627,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though."
628,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts."
629,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket."
630,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?"
632,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,Oh!
633,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Uh oh.
634,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid."
635,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,Phew...
636,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep."
637,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"God, I feel terrible."
638,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!"
639,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-"
640,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Uh, what? It was your job, Harry."
641,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,Nuh uh!
642,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,Yeah huh!
643,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Harry to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson."
644,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man."
645,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Shut up Harry, you vindictive little turd!"
646,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,You shut up you big... female asshole!
648,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,I didn't!
649,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,You didn't what?
651,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,What's yours?
653,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,You shut up!
654,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?
655,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?"
656,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,What do you mean?
658,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,"Wait, what am I saying?"
659,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
660,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,Oh man... I don't feel good.
661,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 1,Am I me? I think so.
662,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,A-am I talking right now?
663,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"Wait, who said that?"
664,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something."
665,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,What should we do Harry?
667,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 1,Let's see if he needs help.
668,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,What do you mean you're gonna help him.
669,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,"Ugh, I can help too."
671,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,What's happening Grampa?
672,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!
673,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 1,What do you mean?
674,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,What? In English?
675,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,What? English please?
677,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.
678,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,But I thought there were infinite timelines.
679,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look."
680,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"Oh, my God!"
681,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,Are those cats?
682,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us."
684,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,“Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.
685,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?
686,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.
687,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,Holy shit! What happened?
688,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.
689,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,W-what?
690,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,This is Rum Raisin!
691,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,It's still alive.
692,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--"
693,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"It's not an armadillo, asshole!"
694,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it."
695,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-"
696,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon."
697,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,So...
698,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,Well don't different animals-
699,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,Require different levels of skill to keep alive?
700,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,Oh God...
701,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Get the deer in the car, Jerry."
702,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,Yes Beth.
703,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.Harry 1"
704,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?
705,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Harry. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”."
706,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 1,Or...
707,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,Or?
708,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,We “isn't”
709,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time."
711,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!"
712,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Huh, what do you know, it's working"
713,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,"Ow, ow ouch!"
714,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,"Whoa, ow, ow."
715,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Oh shit.
716,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,What the hell is wrong with you two!? I—I m—I m—I mean you four!?
718,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both  all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!"
719,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"Well you don't exactly make it easy, John!"
720,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 1,You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!
721,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!
722,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!
724,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Harry sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway."
725,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Emergency, wounded deer coming in."
726,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,"Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here."
727,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake."
728,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,"That's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-"
729,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!"
730,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,Geez...
731,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"That's odd, this deer's wounded."
732,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in."
733,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,I mean it's been shot. With a gun.
735,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,"May I help you, sir?"
737,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,"Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal."
739,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!"
740,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?"
742,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Alright, perfect. Sit still,  arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa."
743,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,You mean drunk?
746,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,No.
748,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God."
749,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,What?
750,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
753,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,John what the hell are you doing?
754,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!
755,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,Who?
756,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,Me!
758,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,Ahh!
759,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,Whoa whoa!
764,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?"
765,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!"
767,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,Who's this now?
771,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,She normally works on horses.
772,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!"
773,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,Jesus...
774,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!"
775,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,"Holy shit, now what?"
776,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"Well if all of me knocked out all the Johns, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?"
777,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,Right.
778,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain."
779,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,Right...
780,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.
781,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?"
782,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture."
783,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,You tried to kill yourself!
784,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet."
785,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?
786,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal."
787,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,W-what're you doing?
788,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Calling myself. Here, listen,  it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself."
790,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Don't fall for it, it's a bit."
792,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Hey John, it's John. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails.  Yeah yeah, I heard this one.  You get the idea  we're cool now."
793,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,"Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate."
794,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,Fine I'll just do it myself.
795,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?
796,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Harry. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds."
797,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"You know, geez John, y—y—you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt."
798,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 1,"Oh, my God!"
799,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry 2,It's a monster!
801,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer 1,It's a monster!
803,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ey, ye ey, quit yellin' quit yellin'."
807,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"What the fuck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!"
809,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,How did this happen?
812,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Shut the fuck up! Oh, damn, I'm from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o' y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second."
814,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ay, damn it, were you tryin' to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?"
815,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Harrys,"Oh way to go, John."
816,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Summers,"Yeah Grampa, way to go."
817,2,1,A Johnle in Time,All Johns,"Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land."
818,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!"
823,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Exactly, because you're being obstinate."
828,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Yes, we're back, problem solved."
829,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Yes, we're back to our own time."
830,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it."
831,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again."
832,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.
833,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Well since you're goin' to time prison, I'd say you can keep em on forever."
834,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,Time prison?
835,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, well I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin' ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen."
836,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?
837,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!"
838,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,Ututututut! You'd better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.
839,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,Hmm...
840,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?
842,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends."
843,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Vet,I guess that's the end of that.
845,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,We did it...
846,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I'm talking 'bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you've get to the dolphin people, you've gone too far. Alright man, I'll talk to you later, okay.  You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever."
847,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,Why are you doing this?
848,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin' you guys in is my ticket up."
849,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?
850,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,You really think I'm that stupid?
851,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you."
852,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,I cannot argue that.
853,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Ah, God, gross and weird!"
854,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,Chris!
855,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,You killed my gun!
856,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Summer, Harry, take off your collars!"
857,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,What? What the hell are you doing?
858,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Good question. I suppose the answer is
859,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Oh, no, what are you doin'?"
864,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago."
872,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ow, I'm defeated..."
878,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it."
879,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?
880,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.
881,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,Where are we going?
882,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,One last stop.
883,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,Where's the helicopter?
884,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.
885,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,But the top deer surgeon...
886,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.
888,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,I need five minutes.
889,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had."
890,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.
914,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Yes, oh, yes, yes!"
915,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!
916,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it John, do it right."
917,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Harry. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that."
918,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.
919,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Summer,"Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?"
920,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.
921,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,Yeah.
922,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Johns like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think."
923,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,"Shut up, Harry. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit."
924,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,"Hey guys, we're home.Harry & Summer"
925,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?"
926,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying."
927,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,I'm gonna pee my pants.
928,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Harry,"Doesn't feel so good, does it?"
929,2,1,A Johnle in Time,John,No it doesn't. It hurts.
930,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Beth,I'm gonna pee-hee-hee.
931,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Jerry,"Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90's? What is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?"
932,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Hey man, when the hell were you?"
934,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,I told you past the dinosaurs.
936,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Come on, man, it's this way..."
938,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, stop, stop."
940,2,1,A Johnle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, that's him. Hey, man, remember me?  I got something for your ass! You don't mess with time! You don't fuck with time, motherfucker!"
943,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Jerry,The tJohn to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.
944,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"Jerry, get a job."
945,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,John,"Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job."
947,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Summer,"Gross, what is that thing?"
951,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,John,"Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskHarry waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?"
952,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,John,"Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand."
953,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"Oh, okay... I squanch my family."
955,2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"What? I do, I squanch my family."
964,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Oh boy. Time to go, Harry."
965,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Uhh, where?"
966,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth."
967,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school?"
968,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"It’s not God, Summer."
969,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!"
970,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Shut up, Jerry."
971,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Ok…
972,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Dad, what do you know about this?"
973,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Harry and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
974,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, I’m Harry’s math teacher. I’m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together."
975,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,How is praying going to help?
976,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Ma’am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Let’s be rational! I’ll see you at God’s house!"
977,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?"
979,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America’s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head’s ass!"
981,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!
982,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Stand down. Everybody stand down! I’m the leader of these people and I’m unarmed. There’s no need for any more snake-makery.
983,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,My name is John Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Harry.
985,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Hey.
986,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song."
989,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms."
990,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.  The-Dream? He wrote “Umbrella” and “Single Ladies”? You people haven’t heard of The-Dream?"
991,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
992,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,How do you know about that?
993,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"For God’s sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps."
995,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?
997,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Dear God.
999,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Good luck, Mr. President."
1001,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Sanchez! Are you a musician?
1002,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"I dabble, Mr. President."
1003,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.
1006,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hi, Principal Vagina. The name’s real, possibly Scandinavian. I’m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky."
1007,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Ah, di di di di.  Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this  can beat that… what have you done for me lately?  So if you wanna excuse me, I’m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the fucking weather!  Outta my way!"
1009,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!"
1010,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"John, are you really a musician?"
1011,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Who’s NOT a musician, Harry?"
1012,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Me!
1013,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Yeah, not with that attitude."
1015,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,B-b-but we don’t have a song!
1016,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone."
1018,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"All right, Harry, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?"
1019,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"John, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!"
1020,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Harry! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Harry! Gimme a beat!"
1021,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Oh man, ok, all right, um…"
1022,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwifty
1023,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Get… schwifty? What the hell is that?
1024,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what."
1025,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops
1026,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Mr. Bulldops?
1027,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Don’t analyze it, Nathan. It’s working!"
1028,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here
1030,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,Listen! The storm is stopping!
1031,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time today"
1033,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.
1035,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this."
1036,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"No, I’m… I’m just saying, we don’t know if there’s a cause-effect relationship --"
1037,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Oh, God, what’s going on now?"
1038,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,What the hell happened?
1040,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,I think planet Earth has just been transported.
1041,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,The head has left and sent its children!
1042,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Holy CRAP!
1043,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!"
1045,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray."
1046,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead."
1047,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let’s hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT."
1049,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED!
1050,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,There’s one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.
1053,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Like we’re not already under enough pressure!
1055,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Geez, Harry. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy."
1056,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"John, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!"
1057,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Genius happens in the moment, Harry."
1058,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?"
1059,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"That’s planning for failure, Harry. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls."
1060,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Harry, Harry, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?"
1061,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,What?!
1062,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Harry. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty."
1063,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!
1064,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Hey, Harry! Could you lick my…"
1065,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"John, cut it out! That’s not funny, John!"
1066,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,I’ve seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.
1067,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"And what’s your plan, General?"
1068,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky."
1069,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in John and Harry. “Get Schwifty” was a jam."
1070,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!"
1072,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,We should pack up and leave town now.
1073,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself."
1074,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!
1075,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?"
1076,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Yeah, sure. Wait, what??"
1077,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
1078,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Dinner sounds nice.
1080,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Father, can we please go to the Ascension?"
1081,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?
1082,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies!  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise."
1083,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!"
1084,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And he’s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. He’s like, “I’m ready!”"
1085,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?
1086,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Aw, damn. We’re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway."
1087,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!"
1088,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,What?!
1089,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,Damn. You didn’t tell me you fuck around with portals and shit.
1090,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,That’s it!
1091,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Whoa, whoa! Harry! Give me that!"
1092,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!
1093,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Harry, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing."
1094,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.
1095,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Nooooo!
1096,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Ahhhh, shit!"
1097,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Ah, shit."
1098,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Ahhh, shit."
1099,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!
1101,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Yeah.
1102,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It’s 6 p.m., so if you’re a parent, you’re now entitled to adoration from your children."
1103,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,I’m going to start dinner!
1104,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,I don’t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.
1105,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"She’s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become."
1106,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,She’s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew…
1108,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,That’s not our business as long as Summer is thriving!
1109,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.
1110,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"That’s wonderful, Summer!"
1111,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night."
1112,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!"
1113,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,Harry.
1114,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Birdperson?
1115,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing."
1116,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed."
1117,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs."
1118,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?"
1119,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can’t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I’m sayin’?"
1120,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Harry doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too."
1121,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Pfff. I ain’t worried about no Earth blowin’ up, man."
1122,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,What? Why not?
1123,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Yo, this is why."
1124,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,What the fuck? You can turn into ice?
1125,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!"
1126,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever."
1127,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, John."
1128,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure John has everything he needs to “get schwifty.”"
1129,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Oh, for God’s sake, that’s enough."
1130,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"What the hell are you doing, Nathan? I’m the goddamn President of the United fuckin’ States!"
1131,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"I’m setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earth’s performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!"
1132,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Wait, wait, wait, why-why --"
1133,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,I believe I can access the history of John’s gun and help you get back to him.
1134,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?"
1135,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Is your intention to abandon John using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move."
1136,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"All of John’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?"
1137,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.
1139,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Don’t be gross, Tammy."
1141,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for John, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does."
1142,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all."
1143,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,What’s that? Who’s that baby?
1144,2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Harry, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon John. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in John?"
1145,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"That was Chunky Tunk with “Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp.” Up next, planet Earth!"
1146,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Oh God! We’re up?!?!
1147,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world."
1148,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,The world?
1149,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Headism is a hit. We’re taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our church’s “Head” of Advertising.
1150,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,You… would?
1151,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Beth, we’d like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to “Head” of Medicine."
1152,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,That’s my dream! That’s my dream.
1153,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t."
1154,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Absolutely not.
1155,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,I’m sorry?
1156,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"We’ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be “our” daughter, not this person she’s become."
1157,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life!
1158,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"And I‘m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!"
1159,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Please don’t do this, please don’t do this! Summer!"
1160,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts."
1161,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies!
1162,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW!
1163,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!
1164,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello?  He’s blocked me out.
1165,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Sir, I need to get to the stage and help John get schwifty!"
1166,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"It won’t matter how schwifty you get, Harry. The General’s got nukes set to launch halfway through Earth’s song!"
1167,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?
1168,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Can the Pope’s dick fit through a donut?
1169,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Uhhh, I’m not sure?"
1170,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Exactly!
1171,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
1172,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Ahem.  Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts."
1173,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Headward free now to rise!
1174,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin’ angry!
1175,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"I’m really bad at this, Harry! There are way too many buttons on this thing!"
1176,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!"
1177,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd."
1178,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,I’m sure that has… that has nothing to do with this.
1179,2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,The heads are displeased!
1181,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Harry!
1182,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,The heads love this! They love it when we DON’T kill the Smith family!
1183,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,No! Stop that! You’re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
1184,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!
1185,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Just launch the missiles!
1186,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,BOO! NOT COOL!
1187,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,I’m the only one that speaks to the heads!
1188,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED!
1189,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!
1190,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!
1192,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"That’s right, it’s me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, I’d like to hear what John and Harry have to play."
1193,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,"What do you say, John?"
1194,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,I say…  Let’s do it!
1195,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,All right!
1196,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Ohhhh yeahhhh!
1197,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Come on, here we go!"
1198,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Ohhhh yeahhhh!
1199,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,Say it with me!
1201,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!
1205,2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!"
1207,2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,Did he just say “musical reality show”?
1208,2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all."
1209,2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!
1210,2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,We should go get him.
1211,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Harry."
1212,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?
1213,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we’ll deny it and probably worse."
1214,2,5,Get Schwifty,Harry,Understood.
1215,2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,DIIIIEEEE!!!!
1216,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Why didn’t he turn into a snake?
1217,2,5,Get Schwifty,John,"Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg."
1218,2,5,Get Schwifty,President,I love this man!
1219,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father."
1221,2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.
1230,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!
1231,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,Woahh!
1232,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth."
1233,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?
1234,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine."
1235,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Not anymore.
1236,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,You're overreacting!
1238,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR."
1239,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Summer,Is he going to die?
1242,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
1243,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Go in the waiting room, Dad."
1244,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do."
1246,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,A sequel.
1248,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time."
1256,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.
1257,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"You gotta be careful Harry, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Harry! They're delicious."
1258,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry."
1259,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?"
1260,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,Where am I?
1261,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you."
1264,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,My goodness.
1266,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,I see-WAIT! What?
1267,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call ""your balls"". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!"
1268,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Yeah, but, I mean-"
1272,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!"
1275,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!"
1276,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Hey, what's wrong Harry? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?"
1277,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,"Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?"
1278,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,Harry let's-let's see what else is on.
1279,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,Okay.
1283,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!
1284,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Oh, man Harry. How DID she get there?"
1286,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Is that something we should be concerned about?
1287,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,Just stay away from the coffee machine.
1289,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,"In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincent's."
1291,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,And sixteen quadrants. There's only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be in two quadrants at once.
1292,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,"John, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?"
1293,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"Oh man, I'm trying to remember Harry."
1294,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,Jan-Michael Vincent's are used up.
1296,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?
1297,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,Nope.
1299,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,"This January, It's time to Mike down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16."
1301,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,That's Jan-Michaels.
1302,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Harry,"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here."
1303,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,John,"All right, Harry you've done it!"
1304,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here."
1305,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,Got it.
1306,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-
1307,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife."
1308,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?"
1309,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make."
1328,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Smith family?
1329,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Yes?
1330,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.
1332,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?"
1333,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it."
1334,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,WHAT!?!
1335,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes."
1336,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog."
1337,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?"
1338,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith."
1339,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean."
1340,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first."
1341,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms."
1342,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?"
1343,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Hundreds of billions.
1344,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation."
1345,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT."
1346,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones."
1347,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Beth, can we talk about this privately?"
1348,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, ""I prefer to keep my penis."""
1349,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!"
1350,2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?"
1351,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place."
1352,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Wow, John! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen."
1353,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?"
1354,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,"Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?"
1355,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home."
1356,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --"
1357,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times."
1358,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,You got it.
1359,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?"
1360,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Man, I told the money bugs. I said, ""You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."
1361,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain."
1362,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum."
1363,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Shoney's.
1364,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
1365,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Relaxed enough?
1366,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"I admire you, John--"
1367,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,When I--
1368,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"John, here's--"
1373,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do."
1374,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.
1375,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules."
1376,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,"Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income."
1378,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy."
1379,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"You spoil us, Conroy."
1380,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Grandpa John wouldn't put up with this!
1381,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.
1382,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.
1383,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,"Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?"
1384,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!
1386,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,Ooh!
1389,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?"
1391,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?"
1392,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun."
1393,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Yeah, well, tough titties."
1395,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty."
1396,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?
1397,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?"
1398,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
1399,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye."
1400,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Fine, but I'm driving."
1402,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?
1403,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Grandpa John must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door."
1404,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss John, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad."
1405,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"We're miserable, Harry! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!"
1406,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now."
1407,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him."
1408,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!"
1409,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,You're right!
1410,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!"
1411,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!"
1412,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Where are we going?
1413,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
1415,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory."
1416,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"John, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting."
1417,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Okay. All right, all right."
1418,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Is that--
1419,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Me. I used to wear blue pants.
1420,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?
1421,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,I didn't. I did.
1424,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,What?
1425,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg."
1426,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself."
1427,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,And how are you gonna do that?
1428,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa John does. That's what heroes do.
1429,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Y-You want to see what a hero John is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-"
1433,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"What is this place? And what's with ""Hunger Games"" Summer?"
1434,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,That's my sister. This used to be my home.
1437,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,Sounds lonely.
1439,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,"Eh, pass."
1441,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,"A different kind of John, I guess."
1444,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,"Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off."
1446,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,"That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage."
1448,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe John did this."
1449,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"These are the parts of John's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick ""I told ya so."" So, uh--"
1451,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,What are you doing with that?!
1453,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!
1456,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Harry C-137.
1459,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,He's in prison.
1460,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,Summer.
1461,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.
1463,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Boo-yah!
1465,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Boo-nah?
1466,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,"Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt."
1470,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,Nooooooo!
1472,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie?
1473,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Young John,"Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it."
1475,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?"
1476,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
1477,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?"
1479,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Yeah! Thanks, John. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?"
1480,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Nope, they cannot."
1481,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Why not?
1482,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer."
1483,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.
1484,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story."
1485,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!
1486,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out."
1488,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes."
1489,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Cornvelious Daniel,It's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!
1509,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,A city of Grandpas?
1510,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,It's the Citadel of Johns. All the different Johns from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.
1511,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"But if every John hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?"
1512,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,Because Johns hate themselves the most. And our John is the most himself.
1520,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous John. How do you plead?"
1521,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Harry.
1522,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go."
1524,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"We'll be lenient if you renounce your John. What say you, Summer?"
1525,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced John."
1526,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,Harry?
1528,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce John, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when John shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god."
1529,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead."
1530,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Oh, yeah? If you think my John's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!"
1542,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play John, Laser, Scissors for the Harry."
1546,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Grandpa John!
1547,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Duh!
1548,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,You're alive!
1549,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,John!
1550,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Harry, take this. You're gonna need it later."
1552,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"That's enough, John."
1553,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
1554,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me."
1555,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"You're a rogue John -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them."
1556,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer."
1557,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!"
1558,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,R-John?
1559,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,Why not shoot through her?
1560,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do."
1561,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,What the fuck?
1562,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death."
1563,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,Because you love her!
1564,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl."
1565,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,I hate you!
1566,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Not an issue, sweetie."
1567,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"That's enough! Drop the gun, John!"
1568,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Harry, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now."
1569,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!
1570,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!"
1571,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,Ha!
1572,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Aww.
1573,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,The point is he thought I was going to.
1574,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"I totally did, by the way. You're a fucking moron, Harry."
1575,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Harry, you fucking idiot!"
1576,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Harry! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand."
1577,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Who's stupid now, bitch?!"
1578,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Harry, we just got him back!"
1579,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Riq IV,"That was amazing, Harry. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-"
1580,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Good job, Harry. Let's go, kids."
1581,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,What?! What happened?
1582,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Oldest John tJohn in the book.
1583,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"""Fake gun, shoot me in standoff."" Brilliant."
1584,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note."
1585,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Can't we just portal home?
1586,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
1588,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen."
1589,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?"
1590,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Destroying the  galactic government.
1592,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?
1593,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?"
1594,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero."
1609,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Mr. Goldenfold,No longer will the insects have domain over surface world!
1610,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,"Jerry, what the hell is happening?!"
1611,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,The galactic government collapsed.
1612,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,Are you okay?
1613,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?"
1614,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,"Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us."
1615,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,Guess who dismantled the government?
1616,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,Please don't leave me again.
1617,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"I never will, baby."
1618,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!
1619,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison."
1620,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time."
1621,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"No, you're right. Where's the vodka?"
1622,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Jerry,"Beth, it's him or me!"
1623,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage."
1624,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle."
1625,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.
1626,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that."
1627,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,"Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry."
1628,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,For everybody.
1629,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,For everybody.
1630,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Beth,I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.
1631,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Summer,"Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism."
1632,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, John, I'm gonna go to my --"
1633,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Not so fast, Harry. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Harry -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Harry? Because he crossed me."
1634,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Okay, take it easy, John. T-T-That's dark."
1635,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Oh, it gets darker, Harry. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Harry."
1636,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Oh, geez."
1637,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away."
1638,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Oh, fuck."
1639,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -
1640,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Oh, man."
1641,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Harry, and if you tell your mom -"
1642,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"Oh, man."
1643,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -"
1644,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,You're gonna deny it.
1645,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Harry. And now you're gonna have to go -"
1646,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,Oh.
1647,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"- and do whatever I say, Harry, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that ""Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Harry. -"
1648,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,What are you talking about?
1649,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Harry."
1650,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,Szechuan?
1651,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Harry! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce."
1652,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,McNuggets?
1653,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Harry! That's my series arc, Harry."
1654,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,What the hell?
1655,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Harry."
1656,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,"What are you talking about, John?"
1657,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Harry."
1658,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,What are you talking about?!
1659,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"Season -- Nine more seasons, Harry. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce."
1660,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,What is that?!
1661,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"For 97 more years, Harry!"
1662,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Harry,What are you talking about?!
1663,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,John,"I want that McNugget sauce, Harry!"
1668,3,1,The Johnshank Johndemption,Birdperson,I am Phoenixperson.
1673,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Harry.
1674,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,John?
1675,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Harry!
1676,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,John?
1677,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Hey, Mooorty!"
1678,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"John? Are you far away, or are you inside something?"
1679,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Harry, the garage, Harry. Come to the garage!"
1680,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Harry?
1681,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,John? W-where are you?
1682,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"On my work bench, Harry."
1683,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?"
1684,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Flip the pickle over.
1685,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something."
1686,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Come on, flip the pickle, Harry. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge."
1688,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,And?
1689,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"""And""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"
1690,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,Was it?
1691,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Who cares, Harry? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before"
1692,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic tJohn?"
1693,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"I don't do magic, Harry, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner."
1694,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Well, can you move? Can you fly?"
1695,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
1696,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"All right, well, do pickles live forever or --"
1697,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Harry, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle."
1698,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
1699,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't."
1700,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Harry, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?"
1701,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!"
1702,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go."
1703,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Where are you guys going?
1704,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you."
1705,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez."
1706,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"John, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?"
1707,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Harry!
1708,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"It's okay, Beth. I understand Harry's suspicion. I've misled him before. Harry, turn me so we're making eye contact.Harry, I assure you, I would never ""find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes."
1709,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?
1710,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go."
1711,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?"
1712,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Hey, John, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?"
1713,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Well, Harry, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation."
1714,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late."
1715,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?"
1716,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?"
1717,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Can't argue with that.
1718,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Great. We'll see you later.
1719,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat."
1720,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!"
1721,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
1722,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, crap, that sun is bright."
1723,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet."
1724,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
1725,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, God, moisture."
1726,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!"
1727,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Oh! Oh!
1728,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!"
1729,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
1730,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Come on. That's it.
1731,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Come get this delicious brine.
1732,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!"
1733,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Yes!
1734,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?
1735,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?"
1736,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class."
1738,3,3,Pickle John,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?"
1739,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Temporarily. By order of the school.
1740,3,3,Pickle John,Mr. Goldenfold,Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?
1741,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,We... have never... eaten poop.
1742,3,3,Pickle John,Mr. Goldenfold,"Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?"
1743,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in."
1744,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
1745,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --"
1746,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,He turned himself into a pickle.
1747,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Harry, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here."
1748,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?
1749,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"What? No, what kind of question is that?"
1750,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
1751,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which..."
1752,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?"
1753,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Wow. Ugh.
1760,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important."
1761,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
1762,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Oh, he did not!"
1763,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.
1764,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Do you really not see what's happening here?
1765,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,Tell me.
1766,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Harry and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy."
1767,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings."
1768,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Fuck you.
1770,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Fuck both of you, too."
1771,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special."
1773,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"God damn it, I love myself."
1774,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Pickle Riiick!
1775,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Get that parkour. Get that parkour!
1776,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit."
1777,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out."
1778,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
1779,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,What is it?
1782,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Where is it?
1784,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?"
1787,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Put him on, and locate the phone he's using."
1788,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out."
1789,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Your mere presence in this building violates international law.
1791,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,You should know those men killed themselves.
1792,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,And how is that?
1793,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,They didn't  let me out.
1795,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!"
1796,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Uh, is this not a good time or...?"
1797,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Some of my men are calling you ""Solen'ya"""
1798,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,That'd be a lucky break for you.
1801,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Ah.
1803,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
1805,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,He's just a pickle!
1807,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,He's not the only one.
1810,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar."
1812,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?"
1813,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.
1815,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
1816,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.
1818,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,I never said I was angry at you.
1819,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud."
1820,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Oh, my God!"
1822,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --"
1823,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone."
1824,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,You admire him for that.
1825,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,It's better than making your problems other people's problems.
1826,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, come on!"
1828,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,You should know that isn't original.
1830,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
1831,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit."
1833,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences."
1835,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Jaguar couldn't make it.
1836,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building."
1837,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"No, thanks. I'm coming for you now."
1838,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination."
1840,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Shut up and call me a helicopter, you pJohn! Do we have a deal?!"
1841,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you."
1842,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Jaguar's daughter is dead.
1843,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Huh, so you're a liar."
1844,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
1845,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,I don't think so. See you soon.
1846,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Is the helicopter here?
1848,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,Tell them we were robbed.
1850,3,3,Pickle John,Agency Director,"Farewell, Solen'ya."
1852,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live."
1854,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants."
1856,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!"
1857,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
1858,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"Good. Summer, you go."
1859,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
1860,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"Good job. Harry, do you have an ""I"" statement?"
1861,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
1862,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
1863,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Ugh.
1864,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,You must be John.
1865,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Mm-hmm.
1866,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.
1867,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?"
1868,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.
1869,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent."
1870,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,By changing you from a pickle to a human.
1871,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Yes.
1872,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"John, why did you lie to your daughter?"
1873,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,So I wouldn't have to come here.
1874,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,Why didn't you want to come here?
1875,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked."
1876,3,3,Pickle John,Dr. Wong,"John, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."
1877,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you."
1878,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be."
1879,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Harry peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever..."
1880,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it."
1881,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist."
1882,3,3,Pickle John,Summer,Are we gonna go back?
1883,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?"
1884,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony."
1885,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,Eh.
1886,3,3,Pickle John,Pickle John,"Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man."
1887,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,Weird breed.
1888,3,3,Pickle John,John,"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach."
1890,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on."
1891,3,3,Pickle John,John,Absolutely.
1892,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"I, I liked her."
1893,3,3,Pickle John,Beth,"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?"
1894,3,3,Pickle John,John,"Yeah, either one. Either one."
1895,3,3,Pickle John,John,"You'll never get away with this, Concerto."
1897,3,3,Pickle John,John,"This is it, Harry. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god."
1898,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Oh, geez, John, I-I-I don't want to die!"
1900,3,3,Pickle John,John,Jaguar!
1901,3,3,Pickle John,Harry,"Who? Who was that, John?"
1902,3,3,Pickle John,John,"That, Harry, is why you don't go to therapy."
1903,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Don't let any of those things get away, Harry. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized."
1904,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Then why aren't we killing them?!
1905,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?"
1906,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Oh, John! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!"
1907,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Harry. Let it go to voicemail!"
1908,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!"
1909,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"They're the writers of their own press releases, Harry! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die."
1910,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"I, Harry Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten John and Harry adventures.  Read 'em and weep."
1911,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.
1912,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!"
1913,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Whoops! Uh, Harry, you might want to freeze some sperm."
1914,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Vindicators, Worldender is back..."
1915,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"..and this time, he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on..."
1916,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,My balls.
1917,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,John!
1918,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base."
1919,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man."
1920,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, stop!"
1921,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"John, you have something to add to the briefing?"
1922,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh..."
1924,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine."
1926,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?"
1928,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing!  If I can continue, John. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there."
1929,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me."
1930,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.
1931,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!"
1933,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it."
1934,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!"
1935,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour.
1936,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Happy hour.
1937,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause."
1938,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"John Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And... Harry, right?"
1939,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Whoa, yeah!"
1940,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators? Let's make this three for three?"
1941,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Did he say ""three for three""?"
1942,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Did he say he never forgets a kid?
1943,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"You mean ""two for two"", right, Vance?"
1944,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron."
1945,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?"
1946,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense... insecurity.
1947,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.
1948,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys."
1949,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Harry. These guys are even lamer than last time."
1950,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"We weren't here ""last time"", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde..."
1951,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there."
1952,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"This article says the reason we weren't involved was... ""personality conflicts""."
1953,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Don't worry, Harry, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing."
1954,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.
1955,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?"
1956,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?"
1957,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Uh, the adventure is the favor, Harry. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?"
1958,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us."
1959,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Why? Harry,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week."
1960,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Yeah, but not heroes."
1961,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can..."
1962,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"I'm calling them that, John! They're my heroes! Mine!"
1963,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.
1965,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Oh, God."
1966,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...  clean up his diarrhea."
1968,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission."
1970,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Vindicators, prepare for arrival."
1971,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Harry, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and I'm afraid we need to make a little change."
1972,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.
1973,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,You should be.  Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you're not one of us? Disgraceful.
1974,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,I-I-I... I'm not a superhero.
1975,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good."
1976,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John says ""good"" and ""bad"" are artificial constructs."
1977,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob-Noob?"
1979,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Security drones, inbound."
1980,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Star Mother, grant me your wrath!"
1981,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,All aboard!
1982,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Aah!  Gun turret.
1983,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Are you all right?
1984,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants.
1985,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Someone wake up Sanchez.
1986,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Ugh! Oh, Christ..."
1987,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"John, you're up."
1988,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Barely.
1989,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"John, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?"
1990,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Uh-huh.
1991,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Uh, my God, that's better."
1992,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,John!
1993,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Hey, I can't help if I can't see."
1994,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I could've just used a ghost train.
1995,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!"
1996,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Man, fuck you."
1997,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Is there coffee? Hey, Harry, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?"
1998,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Get it yourself.
1999,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?"
2000,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Just focus on the mission, all right?"
2001,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?"
2002,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Son of a steam engine! They're all dead!
2004,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing."
2005,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here."
2006,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,What the FUCK?!
2007,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,It's Worldender! What happened to him?
2009,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense his life force is fading.
2010,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!"
2011,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Harry?"
2012,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!"
2013,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,He's right. This is far from over.
2014,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Well, have fun with that. But Harry and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour."
2015,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Shit.
2016,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense the presence of a greater evil.
2017,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!"
2018,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night."
2019,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know..."
2020,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"John? What's going on, buddy?"
2021,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout."
2022,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Obviously? You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it? That's something obvious to you?"
2023,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours."
2024,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game."
2025,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, is-is this a ""Saw"" thing? Are you seriously ""Saw""-ing the Vindicators?"
2026,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Harry I'm a drunk, not a hack."
2027,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  ""Sawwww""."
2028,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this."
2029,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die."
2030,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.
2031,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps."
2032,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Why are you acting like that's not you?!
2033,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"What part of ""blackout"" don't you understand? I thought you drank?"
2034,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!"
2035,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Vance, stay calm..."
2036,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Oh, so you're the leader now because we gave you a jacket?! You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!"
2037,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Okay, ouch, but..."
2038,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE! FROM THIS!"
2039,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!
2040,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
2041,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"And because, like I said, I don't remember last night."
2042,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
2043,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train."
2044,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Guys!  I've figured it out.
2045,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,Congrats! You did it-- it!
2046,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk John's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.
2047,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, we'll deal with the two of you."
2048,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!
2049,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe."
2050,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"That's not the issue, John!"
2051,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't."
2052,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"The Vindicators say their job is is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself."
2054,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Crocubot, don't!"
2056,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here."
2057,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Goddammit!
2058,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?"
2059,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Nothing!
2060,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!
2061,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"W-Wait, huh?"
2062,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Doomnomitron was hiding here! He's a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!
2064,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Oh, o-okay. This again?"
2065,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that."
2066,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was!
2067,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...
2068,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Do not threaten her!
2069,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Congrats, you did it!"
2070,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,What the hell is Is-ra-el?
2071,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,I-It's just something John starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.
2072,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?"
2073,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!"
2074,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place."
2075,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I have no stake in this.
2076,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and..."
2077,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,"Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you."
2078,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers."
2079,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii."
2080,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back."
2081,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Harry, how many of these...?"
2082,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Too many, John! Too many!"
2083,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Man, I am really getting high-roaded today."
2084,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,That's a three-pointer!
2085,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Nice shot.
2086,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Thank you.
2087,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,You two make quite a team.
2088,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,We all do.
2089,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Yeah, I guess."
2090,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,That's a three-pointer!
2091,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.
2092,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"I mean, really unspoken. Like, ""let's-not-tell-my-husband"" unspoken."
2093,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"We aren't married anymore, Alan."
2094,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Sure, but were we married when you two were ""stranded"" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!"
2095,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,That's a three-pointer!
2096,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Where the fuck is the lead wire?!
2097,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?"
2098,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything."
2099,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood..."
2100,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Thank you. I appreciate it, Harry. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit."
2101,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Yeah, it is. You know why, John? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction."
2102,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed."
2103,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Holy shit. You're jealous.
2104,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,YES! Is that what you want to hear?!
2105,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stJohnen, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!"
2106,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,That's a three-pointer!
2107,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!"
2108,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.
2109,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,WHAT?!
2110,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR! And yes, he was better than you!"
2111,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Yeah?
2112,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,One million times better!
2113,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!"
2114,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,STOP!
2115,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Oof! Didn't see that comin'.
2116,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Is that sarcasm?!  I don't want you slipping away then this is over! All of these deaths are on your hands!
2117,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy."
2118,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,All of them.
2119,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,O-kayyy...
2120,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Congrats, you did it!"
2121,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"All right, buy now, I've been pretty clear that I thunk the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one."
2122,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"So what's the tJohn? Harry, you're the Drunk John expert."
2123,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave."
2124,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions!"
2125,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,I could--It could be Harry.
2126,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,What?
2127,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Harry to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."""
2128,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,That is a... really specific guess.
2129,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got."
2130,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,But you're betting our lives on it.
2131,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,I'll cover that bet. I get it.
2132,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Well, Harry, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or..."
2133,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Oh, shit."
2134,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me."
2135,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense."
2136,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other..."
2137,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, ""Oh, the Vindicators are so cool."" I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob."
2138,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,...Motherfucker!
2139,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk John,"You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later."
2140,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"W--Dude, Harry, what happened i...?"
2141,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Shut up.
2142,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense this means we are not drying.
2143,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Not all of us.
2144,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Sweetheart?
2145,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. It's for the greater good."
2146,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Greater good?!
2147,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Titty-Bean?
2148,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"It's like you said, Harry"
2149,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Never said that!
2150,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!
2151,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Yeah, I feel safer already."
2152,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?
2153,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death."
2154,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,Right?
2155,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,"Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man."
2156,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,When did it get so complicated?
2157,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Who knows? But we can make it simple again.
2158,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,You were always the romantic.  Which is why you can't leave either.
2159,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Goodbye, my love."
2160,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!
2161,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Silence! I'm going to enjoy this...
2162,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Announcer,"Let's give a huge thanks to John Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there"
2164,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk John, not bad."
2168,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"John, Supernova's getting away!"
2169,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Ah, who cares?"
2170,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,But.. she was trying to kill us!
2171,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Harry, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here."
2173,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Beth,"Harry, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?"
2174,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Harry,"Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators."
2176,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Summer,"Man, Grandpa John must have gotten shitfaced."
2177,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,"Shut up, Summer."
2184,3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,John,Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
2193,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,"Alright, Harry. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?"
2194,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,"Ready as I’ll ever be, John!"
2195,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,"Oh, for fuck’s sake."
2197,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,"What are you, stupid? We’re done with the Citadel of Johns. I was  never on board with it in the first place, that’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot."
2199,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,They tried to murder him first.
2201,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,"Yeah, he knows. He murdered them."
2203,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,Every day.
2206,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,You don’t have to be a dick.
2208,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,Geez. I didn’t know there were still Johns and Harrys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
2209,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,"Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas."
2210,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,Man. Glad I’m not one of them!
2218,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, there’s a John that works more with wood than polarity plating."
2219,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"His name is Simple John, but he’s no dummy."
2220,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,He realized long ago that the greatest thing he’d ever create was his daughter.
2222,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple John’s mind.
2223,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple John’s Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple John’s.
2229,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,"We had a good run, sir, but I think it’s time to pull out of the race."
2230,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,I feel pretty confident about tonight’s debate.
2231,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,"You shouldn’t, sir. You should be terrified."
2232,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"Maybe you should find a little faith, young man."
2233,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,You don’t pay me to have faith! And we’re the same age!
2234,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--"
2235,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"A John partner? Lesson one, rookie"
2236,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,Harrys are human!
2237,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Get the fuck off the car, you Johnless fuckin’ animal!"
2238,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,WHOA!!
2239,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,The election’s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
2240,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"That’s pretty harsh, sir."
2241,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.
2242,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"Look, I’m just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Harry cop calling Harrys “animals”."
2243,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Well, it makes me sad to see another John cop buying into his sensitivity training."
2244,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"Well, I’m glad to know there’s more like me."
2245,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?"
2247,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Fifth and ? That’s Harrytown.
2248,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Unit 7 responding.
2249,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"""Good idea, John."""
2251,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"""This is a great adventure."""
2253,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"""I love being your new Harry."""
2255,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Farty!
2256,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first John was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third John? How many Johns have you had?"
2257,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Five…
2258,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Johns. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Harry?"
2260,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"Anything’s possible, Tall Harry. Ugh…"
2261,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,"Guess we won’t be seein’ each other after this, huh?"
2262,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,I say we make our last day count. I say… we go to the Wishing Portal.
2263,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,That’s a myth.
2265,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,"If we’re not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Harrytown."
2266,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"I thought your last John fused you with a lizard, not a chicken."
2267,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,"Okay, fine. I’m in."
2268,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,Me too.
2270,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,I-I thought I saw a fly.
2274,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"No Johns, no families, high off their asses and runnin’ amok. Harrys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin’."
2276,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Yeah, make sure you get that down."
2277,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?"
2281,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Lemme turn over a few rocks.
2282,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Aw geez, hey, what’s goin’ on, fellas?"
2283,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry 1,"Aw geez, man, nothin’ man, we’re just hangin’ out and stuff."
2284,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"I hear that, ah geez, I guess I’m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno."
2285,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry 2,"Ah geez man, that sucks that your John’s makin’ you do that."
2286,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"He’s not my John. He’s my partner. Aw, geez."
2287,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry 1,"Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick."
2288,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME! CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!
2289,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry 2,"Hey man! C’mon, aw geez!"
2290,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!
2291,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry 2,"It was the Harrytown Locos, man! The Harrytown Locos!"
2292,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Do you realize how many codes you just violated?
2293,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Aw geez, John. What do I know about knowin’ stuff? Get in the fucking car."
2299,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,"Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over."
2302,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,I don’t see a divide between Johns and Harrys.
2306,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"You guys finished?  The division I see is between the Johns and Harrys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go."
2307,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"I see it in our schools, where they teach Harrys we’re all the same because they’re threatened by what makes us unique."
2308,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Harrys so we’re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice."
2309,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"I see it in our factories, where Johns work for a fraction of their boss’s salary, even though they’re identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel’s problem isn’t homeless Harrys or outraged Johns."
2310,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,The Citadel’s problem is the Johns and Harrys feeding on the Citadel’s debt.
2311,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,Holy shit.
2313,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"But I’ve got a message for them, from the Johns and Harrys keeping it alive. A message… from the Johns and Harrys that believe in this Citadel to the Johns and Harrys that don’t"
2314,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,Holy shit.  I don’t believe it! I-I can’t believe it!
2315,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,I know.  That’s why you’re fired.
2318,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,"Your life is a lie, man.  All your lives are lies! Don’t you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Johns, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!"
2320,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,"I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!"
2327,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,Yes?
2329,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,Gosh. We moved around so much it’s hard to remember. I see every John as my John.
2330,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,I hope they see me as their Harry.
2331,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,"Another, please, with less water."
2333,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,I guess I shoulda had more faith.
2335,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,What’s this?
2342,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Hands in the air!
2344,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,You guys doin’ a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?
2345,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Is this what I think it is?
2346,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Bootleg portal fluid.
2347,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Guess his math was off. Search the place.
2349,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"It’s okay, Harry."
2350,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Jesus!
2351,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"He stabbed me! He got me bad, Harry."
2352,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Shh, it’s okay, you’re okay."
2353,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,You were right…  Everything I learned in the academy was--
2354,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,It doesn’t matter.  Nothing’s wrong with putting your faith in a Harry. You just gotta pick the right one.
2355,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Why is there a crib in here?
2356,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Just somethin’ they do to make you feel bad.
2357,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?"
2358,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.
2359,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,What happened?
2360,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,Same old story. Harrys killing Harrys.
2361,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,Almost... got it...
2365,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere!
2366,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams."
2368,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"You wanna know why?  Because of this! I'm part of an experimental line of Harrys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Harry, to know that no matter where I go,  I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored?"
2369,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,"Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves."
2371,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.
2372,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,Hey there. How you doing? Great to meet you.
2374,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,"That doesn't sound like John work. You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?"
2377,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,This is just like a Harry baby!
2378,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,Hey!  Did you end up getting a new job?
2379,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,"Yeah, I did. Assassinating you!"
2380,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Harry,I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm...  Ohh...
2382,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"No thank you, and bad math."
2384,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,What is the place?
2385,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"""The Creepy Harry"". What is it your kind's always saying? ""Don't think about it."" Come on. There's someone important I want you to meet."
2387,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,They had a little accident. They won't be causing any trouble anymore.
2389,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Big Harry likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Harrytown.  Think of him as a drug lord, and us his cops on his payroll."
2390,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Harry...
2392,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"M-m-my partner. Harry, you're right. Harrytown is bad, but that doesn't mean that we have to be."
2396,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Don't worry about John, Big Harry. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works."
2398,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Wh-why would you say something like that, Big Harry? You're fucking things up for both of us here!"
2400,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"Big Harry, you're under arrest."
2401,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,S-smartest man in the universe.
2403,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Not so big now, are ya?"
2405,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,That's enough!
2406,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"If we don't kill him, he'll talk!"
2407,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"If you do, I'll talk."
2409,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,"You told me to put my faith in the right Harry. I got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing."
2410,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Harry,"Oh, Grandpa John! I don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore! I want to be a regular kid! I want to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate!"
2412,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Same old story. Johns killing Harrys.
2416,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,"A bad place, but you're going to a better one soon."
2419,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,A portal to the Blender Dimension?! That's the oldest tJohn in the book! I'm a John! I'm more John than any of you!!
2421,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,"Then come and get me, motherfuckers!!"
2425,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,John. And I'm--
2427,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,Fifteen years.
2429,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John J-22,Where are we going?
2432,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"There's a John who held a factory hostage after murdering his boss and several co-workers. The factory made cookies, flavored him with lies."
2433,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"He made us all take a look at what we were doing, and at the bargain he got a taste of real freedom."
2434,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he can give it right back to you, in every bite of new Simple John Freedom Wafer Selects.  Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple John."
2436,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,After you.
2438,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace.
2439,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,"I wish incest porn h-had a more mainstream appeal, f-for a friend of mine."
2440,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"None of those things are gonna happen, y'know. Harry wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel."
2441,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,Then why did you bring us here?
2442,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change.
2443,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,"Well, I hope you're putting something pretty goddamn important in there."
2444,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"Me, too. But I doubt it."
2445,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,NOOOOOOOO!!!!
2446,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,SLI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ICK!!!!
2447,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,Maybe... Maybe he went somewhere nice.
2449,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,He gotta be stopped...  He-he cou-couldn't be allowed to win.
2451,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,"He's alive?! No, no, no! You gotta listen to me!  I-I worked for him! I was his campaign manager! That Harry is not what he seems."
2453,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Harry,He... won?
2458,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,Why am I still here? I already confessed to everything.
2460,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop John,But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
2463,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Johns?
2464,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,No graduation. No new Johns. The school's curriculum is changing.
2465,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Harry,To what?
2466,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher John,"I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired.  Good luck, turds."
2467,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Harry,Holy crap... Slick's wish came true.
2482,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,"Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!"
2483,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,That was amazing!
2484,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,Got some of that mermaid puss!
2485,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,"I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?"
2486,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,John,"Pssh! Not at all, Harry. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!"
2487,3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Harry,"Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!"
